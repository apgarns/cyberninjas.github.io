# Ethical Hacker Toolkit

This repository contains an Ethical Hacker Toolkit, a simple web application that provides various cybersecurity tools for ethical hacking purposes. The current version includes an Encryption Tool that uses SHA-256 hashing.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari)

## Running the Application

1. Save the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a single file named `index.html`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. You will see the main page of the Ethical Hacker Toolkit, with various tools listed.
4. Click the "Open Encryption Tool" button to use the Encryption Tool.

## Notes

The Encryption Tool in this version only provides SHA-256 hashing and is for demonstration purposes only. It should not be used for real-world secure encryption.

For more advanced functionality or to integrate with server-side scripts or other tools, you would need to set up a web server and configure it appropriately. This is beyond the scope of the current README.
